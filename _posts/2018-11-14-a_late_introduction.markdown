I guess I was supposed to have written about why I set out to learn to code. 

The primary reason, I suppose, is that the thing I was doing for a living at the time no longer challenged me. It was administrative office work. It doesn't take much to learn to push pencils. I decided that I wanted to move into a field that was, by definition, constantly growing and evolving. 

I'm a learner by nature. I'm most at peace when I'm peeling back another layer of the world to get a better look at the strata underneath. I'm also an anxious person, and for a long time, I would not set out to try to learn a new thing if I thought I wasn't smart enought to get my brain around it. That was a logical fallacy I eventually got on top of; learning is - as far as I can seem to define it - failing repeatedly to understand a thing, until eventually you do. 

My passion has always been in stories; books, short fiction, documentaries, movies, comics, ARGs. The idea that a human being can create something out of nothing. I see the potential for that in coding. The seeds of something useful, beautiful, and human. 

And hopefuly good.
